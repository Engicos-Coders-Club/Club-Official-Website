## Introduction

This project is build using basic [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) with [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) architecture. The plan and prototype for the project is described on the excalidraw Live collaboration Sketch. Feel free to give you suggestion in the excalidraw plan.

## Updates

We have moved the `next-ts` branch into the `main`. So the current project is using Next.js with TypeScript.

## Wireframe and Design

Our project's blueprint and structural planning are currently in progress through live collaboration on Excalidraw. Excalidraw provides a dynamic environment for team members to collectively sketch out the website's layout, sections, and content flow.

Any suggestions on the UI/UX for the website will be highly appreciated.

## Setting Up

Make sure you have [node js](https://nodejs.org/en/download) and [npm](https://docs.npmjs.com/downloading-and-installing-node-js-and-npm) installed

You can use [bun](https://bun.sh/docs/installation) (only for Linux and MacOS users) too. We've set the environment up for it too

1. Install typescript

Cloning and installing this repo should install typescript locally but if you wish to install it globally run:

  ```bash
  npm install -g typescript    
  ```

2. Clone this repo

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Engicos-Coders-Club/club-official-website.git
   ```

3. Once switched, install the necessary packages by using this command

   ```bash

   # or
   pnpm dev
   ```

   Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.

**To convert tsx to jsx use:**

```bash
npm run transpile
```
